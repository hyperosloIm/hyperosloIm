I am a Software Engineer with almost 3 years of experience. for the past year i had my internship at the Apple Developer Academy and started learning iOS development with Swift and SwiftUI. I developed five apps, working with five different teams each time with four other teammates, and tested our apps with over 100 users. I learned a completely new environment to develop in (Apple environment) within just 1 month. I am honoured to say that I was among the top winners of the Apple WWDC Swift Student Challenge 2024 ([more info on my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7179211129062047744/)).

Throughout my career, I have demonstrated super flexibility in learning new technologies quickly and delivering high-quality results. In terms of communication, I have worked as the project and team lead for two of the projects we built in the Academy so far.I learned a ton from working with different people, i made sure that we are on time for shipping our MVP, while fostering a super friendly environment in our team.
